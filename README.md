# NLP_Ergasia_24-25

## Code files:

### - ergasia_1A.ipynb : The code file that corresponds to task 1A. It involves the reconstruction of 2 sentences (1 from each of the 2 texts) via custom automatas.

### - pipeline1.ipynb : First NLP pipeline for text reconstruction (task 1B)

### - pipeline2.ipynb : Second NLP pipeline for text reconstruction (task 1B)

### - pipeline3.ipynb : Third NLP pipeline for text reconstruction (task 1B)

### - parser.ipynb : Syntactic parser that analyzes the structure of a reconstructed sentence from pipeline1,2,3 and the custom pipeline. The results were used to compare and analyze the 4 methods/pipelines (Task 1C)  

### - cos_emb_v2.ipynb : Embeddings-based semantic similarity computations and visualizations (Task 2)

### - pip_requirements.txt : List of required Python libraries to run the code.
